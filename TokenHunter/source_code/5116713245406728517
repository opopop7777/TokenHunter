 *      Welcome to the temporary ????????? contract. It's just
 *      a place-holder for now, with little functionality other 
 *      than being forward compatible with the first version of 
 *      the ????????? contract in current development. 
 *
 *      This contract acts as a temporary store for the ether 
 *      raised each week from the ticket sales of ??????????, 
 *      for the future funding of the charitable arm of the 
 *      enterprise. It is the nascent beginnings of a blockchain 
 *      portal for donations to good causes worldwide, driven by a 
 *      decentralized cadre of ??? token holders, forming part
 *      of a ??? who both own and run ?????????? & ?????????.
 * 
 *
 *                  ???????? ????? - ???? ?????!
 *
 *
 *      Learn more and take part at ?????://??????????.???/???
 *      If you want to chat to us you have loads of options:
 *      On ???????? @ ?????://?.??/??????????
